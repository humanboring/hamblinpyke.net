I'm working on a PHD in experimental psychology at the [University of Manchester](https://www.bmh.manchester.ac.uk), having finished my Masters degree in Neuroscience at the [IOPPN](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/about/index.aspx).

I occasionally post to my blog over at [my blog](https://www.humanboring.net), depending on if I have something I want to write out or if I have the time. You can also check out my micro.blog [here](https://micro.humanboring.net)

If you have some podcasts to recommend, or just want to say hi, have a look at my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bhp_uk).
